# SortedScopeFiller
The idea of this was to made it able to copy whole SortedScope from one vehicle to other without replacing them before you could click button that would later sort ascendingly those ID's, also I wanted to make something that could search for all filles in specific vehicle with ID that would add them to SortedScope.
